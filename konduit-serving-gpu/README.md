# GPU Module

This module contains cuda support for pipelines.
This includes:

1. Tensorflow on cuda
2. Dl4j/nd4j on cuda
3. Gpu metrics for use with prometheus via native nvml integration


Currently, this module assumes cuda 10.1 support.
Note that this module will make jar files significantly bigger than cpu.
