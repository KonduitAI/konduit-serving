# Face detection demo with PyTorch

## Getting started 

First, ensure that you have installed the Konduit Python SDK and built a Konduit Serving JAR file (using `konduit build`) according to the [installation instructions](https://serving.oss.konduit.ai/installation).

Clone the Linzaer/Ultra-Light-Fast-Generic-Face-Detector-1MB repository to this folder. This repository contains a lightweight face detection model built in PyTorch that will be used for this demo.  

```bash
git clone https://github.com/Linzaer/Ultra-Light-Fast-Generic-Face-Detector-1MB
```

Next, install the required modules for this repository. If you encounter any errors with installing the required modules, try installing PyTorch first following the instructions on their [home page](https://pytorch.org/), then running the following command again to install the remaining required modules.

```bash
pip install -r ./Ultra-Light-Fast-Generic-Face-Detector-1MB/requirements.txt
```

## Usage

Run the following command to run this demo: 

```bash
python run_konduit.py
```
