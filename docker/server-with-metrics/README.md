# Konduit Serving Docker Example

This folder contains 3 files for running
a self contained example
with model serving and a metrics dashboard.

Config.json: Contains the serving configuration.

Dashboard.json: A dashboard you can import in to grafana.

Prometheus.yml: A pre configured prometheus data source
that points at the metrics endpoint exposed by the konduit server.

## Running

In order to run this example, first a model server docker container needs to be built.
This can be done in the root directory with:

```bash
mvn -Pdocker -Dchip=cpu -Ppython clean install -Dmaven.test.skip=true
```

Afterwards a docker container that will be used with docker compose
will have been built. Note this is for cpu.
if you want gpu, use -Dchip=gpu.

From the notebook-json-build directory, build the jupyter image next with:

```bash
docker build -t konduit-serving-jupyter .
docker-compose up
```

This will start 3 servers:

[Grafana](https://grafana.com/): The metrics dashboard.

[Prometheus](https://prometheus.io/): The metrics server.

Konduit Serving server:  The actual model serving component.

After this, you can start to sendrequests to the konduit server on port 65322.

## Visualization

In order to visualize metrics from the server,
we need to import the dashboard in to grafana.
In order to do that, we need to import the dashboard.json.

Point your browser to:

```bash
http://localhost:3000
```

When you login, login with:

```bash
User name: admin
Password:  password
```

Click import at the top left:
![Dashboard import](img/dashboardimport.png "Dashboard import")

Copy and paste the json in to the import page as follows:
![Dashboard import](img/jsonimportdashboard.png "Dashboard import")

Afterwards, click import:
![Dashboard import](img/dashboardimportfinish.png "Dashboard import")

Your dashboard will then render:
![Dashboard import](img/dashboardrender.png "Dashboard import")

This dashboard contains metrics for system load and memory as well
as timings for performing inference and ETL.

## Customizing the dashboard

If you want to create a custom dashboard, please read the grafana documentation.
You will also need to learn the prometheus squery language.
In general, just specify a metric name when you create a new dashboard.

## Using the server

Docker automatically starts the server. Now we need to connect using the client.
THe client can either be installed locally or you can use it in docker.

In order to use the client, we need to connect to the port the server started on.

```python
from konduit import Client
input_names = ['default']
output_names = ['default']
port = 65322

client = Client(return_output_type='ARROW',
                input_type='JSON',
                endpoint_output_type='RAW',
                port=port)

data_input = {'first': 'value'}

predicted = client.predict(data_input)
print(predicted)

```

This should be able to connect to the server
and output the server run python script as json.
